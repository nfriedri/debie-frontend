# DEBIE Front-End

DEBIE is a web application developed to demonstrate the by Luscher et al. (2019) in "A general framework for implicit and explicit debiasing of distributional word vector spaces" (accesible under: http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.06092) introduced bias evaluation methods and debiasing models.

The application offers to evaluate bias specifications with the Embedding Coherence Test (ECT), the Bias Analogy Test (BAT), the Word Embeddings Association Test (WEAT) and by K-Means++ clustering.

For debiasing, the General Bias-Direction Debiasing (GBDD) and the Bias Analogy Model are offered, together with compositions formed out of them. 

This repository contains the front-end of the application. The back-end together with the RESTful-API can be found here: https://github.com/nfriedri/debie-backend
